        <description>Progression is an Android game made with Unity that I recently released on Google Play store (that is still downloadable on Google play, link to the download at the bottom). It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me a long time for me to develop this game as the whole system was very easy to implement.
The main point of this development was to make a simple game in a short duration just so I can get more motivated and get the Unity development wheels rolling again, as I took a break after finishing Sketch Hero.</description>

For the past 2 weeks, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a smartwatch project using my Arduino Pro Mini 3.3v (ATMEGA328P @ 8Mhz). My intention is that my smartwatch will connect to my phone and then receive all the data such as time information, notification from it. As it also receives time information, it does not need a RTC (Real Time Clock), benefitting the size of the smartwatch.
For the bluetooth module, I used HM-10 clone, which is a BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) module.</description>

Sketch Hero is my first Unity Android game project that I published to Google Play store which I worked for around a year.
I spent a lot of time developing this game and I&amp;rsquo;m really satisfied how it turned out. I made this game to see how well I know about Unity.
Sketch Hero is an endless runner, which means the player plays the game endlessly while trying to achieve the highest score possible.</description>

        <description>&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;DISCONTINUED&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;&amp;mdash;
Keep in mind I&amp;rsquo;m writing this a year after I stopped making this game. I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother with portfolio or whatsoever back then.
Awaken Sentinel is the first game that I started making seriously on Unity game engine. It&amp;rsquo;s a multiplier FPS with open world aspects. I can&amp;rsquo;t provide any further information to the game, nor the story, as the whole project started just because I wanted to learn something and I didn&amp;rsquo;t plan on publishing at all/have the finished product.</description>
